This is a beta release of the EXCITING FP-LAPW code. The code can be compiled by
first running "./setup" in this directory followed by "make all". This will
compile the main code as well as several auxiliary programs. For optimal
performance we recommend that you tune the Fortran compiler options in the file
"make.inc" and use machine-optimised BLAS/LAPACK libraries. Setting the OpenMP
options of your compiler will enable EXCITING to run in parallel mode on
multiprocessor systems.

The auxiliary programs include "spacegroup" for producing crystal geometries
from spacegroup data, "species" for generating species files, and "eos" for
fitting equations of state to energy-volume data.

EXCITING is updated regularly with new features and bug fixes. This release may
be used for limited production but please check the consistency of the results
carefully.
