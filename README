Compile
	The code can be compiled  by running 
	
	make
	
	in this directory. The first time this will start a setup script. After choosing the
 	platform you will be asked wether you want to build a k-point parallel version using
	MPI and a version that uses multithreaded BLAS/LAPACK. Choose yes or no dependent on
	if you have the required libraries installed on your system. You can manually edit
	the make.inc in the build directory.
	
	The auxiliary programs include "spacegroup" for producing crystal geometries
	from spacegroup data, "species" for generating species files, and "eos" for
	fitting equations of state to energy-volume data.
	
	EXCITING is updated regularly with new features and bug fixes. This release may
	be used for limited production but please check the consistency of the results
