The exciting FP-LAPW Code
=========================

Release: exciting oxygen.  
Copyright (C) 2002-2021 The exciting team.

Description
-----------

exciting is an all-electron full-potential computer package for
first-principles calculations, based on (linearized) augmented planewave
\+ local orbital \[(L)APW+lo\] methods. This family of basis sets is
known as the most precise numerical scheme to solve the Kohn-Sham
equations of density-functional theory (DFT), reaching up to
micro-Hartree precision \[[1](#citing-exciting-%20in-your-work)\].

exciting features include:

+ Ground state DFT with LDA, GGA and hybrid functionals \[[1,
    2](#citing-exciting-in-your-work)\].

+ Time-dependent DFT, both in the frequency domain (with the linear
    response formalism) \[[3](#citing-exciting-in-your-work)\] and
    and in the real-time domain \[[4](#citing-exciting-in-your-work)\].

+ GW in the G0W0 approximation \[[5](#citing-exciting-in-your-work)\].

+ The Bethe-Salpeter equation for both valence excitations
    \[[4](#citing-exciting-in-your-work)\] and core excitations
    \[[6](#citing-exciting-in-your-work)\].
