    "**exciting**, as a code based on plane-wave augmentation, distinguishes between the interstitial and muffin-tin regions. In the interstitial region, different quantities, such as wavefunctions, potential, and density, are described by means of plane waves. The quality (completeness) of this basis is determined by the maximum wavevector defined via either <code><span style=\"color:mediumblue\">gmaxvr</span></code> or <code><span style=\"color:mediumblue\">rgkmax</span></code>. Basis functions in the muffin-tin region are much more cumbersome to define, and thus require a detailed description. Furthermore, each muffin tin is associated with some atom with a certain nuclear charges, mass, *etc*. All this information is summarised in species files.\n",
