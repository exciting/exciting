# Top-level Gitlab Continuous Integration Config File for exciting
#
# Notes
# ---------
# For all builds:
#   The make.inc is a build stage artifact so the test framework can determine the compiler.
#   An ENV variable is not used, because this would require setting each time the test
#   suite is also used locally.

stages:
  - build 
  - python
  - test
