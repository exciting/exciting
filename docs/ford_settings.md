## Description

exciting is an all-electron full-potential computer package for
first-principles calculations, based on (linearized) augmented
planewave + local orbital [(L)APW+lo] methods. This family of
basis sets is known as the most precise numerical scheme to
solve the Kohn-Sham equations of density-functional theory (DFT),
reaching up to micro-Hartree precision [[1](#citing-exciting-in-your-work)].
