! Try and find the equilibrium volume of fcc copper by adjusting the scale
! parameter. The individual lattice vectors can also be scaled separately using
! scale1, scale2 or scale3. Remember that a previously converged charge density
! can be used to begin a new calculation, even at a different volume. This is
! done by setting task=1.
