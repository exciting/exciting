! NaCl monomer in a large box. Note that with molecule=.true., the atomic
! positions are supplied in Cartesian coordinates and the unit cell is set up
! automatically such that the molecules in adjacent unit cells are at a distance
! given by the variable vacuum. Try plotting the 1D density along the molcular
! axis. You can also compute the vibrational frequency using runtype=200.
