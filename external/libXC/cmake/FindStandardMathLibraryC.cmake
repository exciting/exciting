# * downloaded Nov 2016 from https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/eigen/+/master/cmake/FindStandardMathLibrary.cmake
# * changed CXX to C
# * note that full path to libm *not* detected

# SL 2020-10-23: Added more necessary functions for libxc, and changed to a version using standard input

# - Try to find how to link to the standard math library, if anything at all is needed to do.
# On most platforms this is automatic, but for example it's not automatic on QNX.
#
# Once done this will define
#
#  STANDARD_MATH_LIBRARY_FOUND - we found how to successfully link to the standard math library
#  STANDARD_MATH_LIBRARY - the name of the standard library that one has to link to.
#                            -- this will be left empty if it's automatic (most platforms).
#                            -- this will be set to "m" on platforms where one must explicitly
#                               pass the "-lm" linker flag.
